# Ghostbusters Project - Readme

## Project Description

This project involves designing Pacman agents for the Ghostbusters variant. The goal is to create agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts, evolving from single, stationary ghost tracking to hunting packs of moving ghosts efficiently.

## Edited Files

### bustersAgents.py

Implemented agents for playing Ghostbusters, including the `GreedyBustersAgent` that charges the closest ghost, and the `BustersKeyboardAgent` for manual control.

### inference.py

Implemented inference modules for tracking and predicting ghost positions, including **ExactInference**, **ParticleFilter**, **JointParticleFilter**, and **MarginalInference**.
